# Admin Users

The **Users** tab is where Topo users are created and assigned roles. The **Search** feature allows Topo admins to search on the name of a Topo user. To search for a user across all of TopoMojo, enter the term into the **Search** field or filter by *role* or *audience*. 

Recall from workspace Settings that "audience" is a list of clients who can launch the workspace as a gamespace. Selecting an audience filter results in users who are part of that audience.

**Scope:** A space-delimited list of administrator-defined groups the user belongs to. Administrators can define a *scope* with any name here. A user's scope determines which workspaces they have permission to deploy gamespaces from. Users can only deploy a gamespace from a workspace if the user has a *scope* that matches an *audience* defined in the workspace. See also: [Building a new workspace](building-a-workspace.md).
