# Admin Users

The **Users** tab is where Topo users are created and assigned roles. The **Search** feature allows Topo admins to search on the name of a Topo user. To search for a user across all of TopoMojo, enter the term into the **Search** field or filter by *role* or *audience*. 

Recall from workspace Settings that "audience" is a list of clients who can launch the workspace as a gamespace. Selecting an audience filter results in users who are part of that audience.
