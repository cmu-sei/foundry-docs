## Files

The **Files** page in the Topo workspace allows you to upload files from your system to TopoMojo to include in your lab. These files are used as ISOs that can be attached to VMs in the workspace. If your files arenâ€™t already in an ISO file format, TopoMojo wraps them in an ISO after upload.

Unselecting the **Local** filter shows ISOs that are globally available in TopoMojo.
