# Finding a space

Once you're in Topo, you can browse for existing TopoMojo workspaces and gamespaces. In the left panel (`Ctrl-L`) , enter terms into the **Search** field. TopoMojo automatically searches for a workspace or a gamespace that matches your terms. Click **workspace** or **gamespace** to filter results. Topo labs are sorted alphabetically by name.
