## Play 

The **Play** page is where you can interact with your lab in the same way others will when they launch your content or "play" through your challenge.  

**Variant:** Specify which variant of the challenge you wish to play (if it is a _variant_ challenge).

**Max Attempts:** The maximum number of submission attempts allowed when answering questions.

**Max Minutes:** The maximum number of minutes permitted to play before the gamespace expires.

**Point Value:** The point value assigned for this challenge when used with Gameboard in a cyber competition scenario. <!--need more detail here.-->

**Start:** Starts up the gamespace which includes setting the timer, deploying virtual machines, displaying the Markdown document, and making challenge questions available. Individuals get their own Play tab, so when playing, the gamespace environment is unique to you.

**Reset:** Resets the gamespace. <!--seems obvious enough; what other details should be added?-->
