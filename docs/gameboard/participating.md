# Playing in the Gameboard

This topic describes the Gameboard from a participant's point-of-view. A *participant* is a player in a game or a competitor in a competition who has no special role(s) attached them. These instructions assume that a fully configured game environment is available to the reader and they have an account on the Identity server.

1. Browse to the gameboard's designated URL. Some gamecards are visible prior to logging in.
2. Click **Profile**, then **Login**. You're the Identity server now. Here you can login with an existing account or register for a new one.

    This topic requires significant revisions. It's here as a placeholder *only*. Thank you for your patience.

## The Profile screen

**Certificates:** View and print a certificate as proof of participation. Certificates are unique to the player and specific to a game.

**History:** View game history, including where you finished on the scoreboard and whether it was in practice or competition.

**Display Name:** Set a default name for public display that is suitable for all audiences. This name will apply to all new games, however, you can customize it during registration.

**Sponsoring organization:** Select *your* organization. Gameboard admins define who the sponsors are and what image to associate with each. 

## The Home screen

The Home screen is where you start a "live" game, preview upcoming games, and view completed games. Hover over a gamecard and select **Open Game**. Click **Enroll** to proceed to the game lobby.  

## The Game lobby

This is the staging area where players join team members (if playing on a team) and get organized before starting a game session. Information about the session and enrollment appears here in blue: e.g., "Game window closes in
270d 1h." A yellow light indicates a player is registered to play but hasn't started a session. A green light indicates a player is active (i.e., has started a session). A red light indicates that player's session has ended.

**Unenroll** and **Reset Session:** Players can unenroll here or reset a session if their gameboard administrator permits it.

**Set Game Display Name/Set Team Display Name:** The game display name chosen here is used to represent an individual player or a team (based on the competition type) on the public scoreboard for a particular game. This display name is the same as your profile display name by default, but you can change the name of your player/team for a specific game if you choose. Like your *profile* display name, your *game* or *team* display name is subject to approval.

### Organizing a team

If the game is a team game, you organize your team in the game lobby. Under **Set Team Display Name**, enter a team name for the scoreboard. If you're the team manager, generate an invitation for your teammates. Copy the invitation code and distribute it to your teammates. Team members redeem your invitation code here too.

!!! warning
    Team managers: generating a new invitation code invalidates previous invitation codes.

## Starting a session

To start your session, click Start Session and click through the confirmation messages.

!!! warning
    For team players, make sure your teammates are ready to start. You can't add or remove team members after your session has started. Also note that *any* team member can start a session -- the continuous session timer starts when **Start Session** is clicked.  

## Starting a challenge
