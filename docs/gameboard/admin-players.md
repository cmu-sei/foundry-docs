To award bonus points manually:

1. Select the **Admin** menu, hover over a gamecard, then select **Players**.
2. Expand the player view by clicking the player name, player icon, or the down arrow.
3. Select **Manage Challenge Bonuses**. 
4. In the **Manage Bonus Points** dialog, select the challenge you will add points to.
5. In **Bonus description**, provide a reason for awarding the bonus.
6. Add the number of **Points**, select **Add this bonus**. The bonus appears in the dialog, broken down by base and bonus. Continue awarding points or click **Done** when you are finished awarding points.

!!! tip

    You can also get to the Manage Challenge Bonus dialog box by clicking the "triple-dot" context menu and selecting **Manage Challenge Bonuses**.
