# Gameboard Roles

The table below defines roles in the gameboard. Note that these roles aren't additive -- they are independent. Therefore, each role has to be added individually and a single user can have multiple roles. Each assigned role only grants the privileges for that role. Roles do not inherit permissions from other roles.

| Role      | Function                                                     |
