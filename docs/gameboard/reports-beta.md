# Reports [BETA]

As of v3.10.0, Gameboard features a beta version of an overhauled **Reports** module. The new beta Reports module is available to users who have `Admin`, `Registrar`, or `Support` roles in the main navigation bar.

!!! note
    The existing Reports functionality has not been deprecated; reports are still available under **Admin**, **Reports**, **User Reports**, **Board Reports**, etc. 

Three report "cards" display the three reports available in beta:

- **Enrollment Report:** View a summary of player enrollment data; who enrolled when, which sponsors do they represent, and how many played challenges.
- **Practice Area Report:** View metrics on players who are spending free time honing their skills in Gameboard. See which challenges are practiced most, have the best success rates, and which players are accessing the Gameboard to complete challenges in practice.
- **Support Report:** View a summary of support tickets created in Gameboard; including ticket creation and assignment details, ticket categories, and tickets attached to games/challenges .

## Common report characteristics

Each report shares common characteristics. 

- **Filter controls:** Dedicated filter controls allow users to narrow down or restrict the data displayed on a report. For example, if you're interested in seeing enrollments from a given sponsor in the Enrollment Report, use the **Sponsors** filter to select the sponsor(s) you're interested in. If you don't select any values in a filter, all data from that filter included in the results.
- **Copy link to report:** When a report is run, the browser generates a link that represents filter selections for the current report. Select the **clipboard icon** to copy the current report and share it with another Gameboard user. The user whom you are sharing with must have the appropriate Gameboard role and must be logged into Gameboard. You can also copy the link in your browser's address bar and share.

!!! tip
    Bookmark useful filters via the browser so you can return to them quickly.

- **Export to CSV:** To export report results CSV, click **Export to CSV**. 
- **Reset Filters:** Deselecting filter values on multiple filters can be inconvenient. Click **Reset Filters** to deselect all filter values at once.
- **Summary:** Each report contains a summary that presents key data points. For example: the Enrollment Report shows the Leading Sponsor based upon filter selections.

## Drilling down in results

In some places in the report results, you can "drill down" by clicking a link in the metrics. A popup window displays a more granular view within the same data. For example: in the Enrollment Report, in the Performance category, some data points are links. See *screen print 1* below. Clicking that link goes deeper into that element. See *screen print 2* below.
