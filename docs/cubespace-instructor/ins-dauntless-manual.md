## Heads-Up Display (HUD) Controls

The Heads-up Display (HUD) contains a variety of information about the mission and the competition. HUD controls display on the screen when you are viewing the ship. HUD controls help you navigate, manage missions, track decrypted alien codices, and guide you through the *Dauntless*' operations.

### The Mission Log

Challenges can be completed in any sequence and completing some challenges will unlock additional bonus challenges.

## Progress

View competition milestones and metrics in the **Progress** display. Challenges in the **Progress** display are color coded to denote status: *red* indicates an incomplete challenge; *yellow*, a partially complete challenge; *green*, a complete challenge, bonus challenge unlocked. *Gold* indicates bonus challenge complete.

Bonus challenges are unlocked after completing a competition challenge. To attempt a bonus challenge, fly the *Dauntless* to the location of a supply cache. All challenges pertaining to the alien spaceship are simultaneously available when the *Dauntless* is in the Sol system (where Earth is located). **Be warned!** Traveling to another system means you will lose access to all ship challenges. Returning to the Sol system restores access to alien ship challenges. Select a mission to view the mission log.

## System Functions

Workstations on the *Dauntless* can only be used by one crew member at a time. Refer to "Workstation Descriptions" for a refresher on the functions of each workstation.

The Launch Sequence procedure must be followed to successfully launch the *Dauntless*. All launch sequence workstations have an emergency ABORT button. Press ABORT to reset the Launch Sequence.

### Power Management

Effective power management on the *Dauntless* is essential when traveling in deep space. Before and after space travel, the crew should monitor *Dauntless*' Power Workstation to ensure power is routed to the correct mode: **Launch Mode** or **Exploration Mode**.

Quickly toggle between modes by clicking the buttons.

## Launch Sequence

Strict adherence to the Launch Sequence is required to initiate deep space travel. The crew of the *Dauntless* must complete the Launch Sequence anytime CubeDrive technology is used. All challenges pertaining to the alien spaceship are simultaneously available when the *Dauntless* is in the Sol system (where Earth is located). During the course of the competition, additional locations where cache challenges are available can be unlocked. To access these cache challenges, you must travel to the remote location. **Be warned!** Doing so means you will lose access to all ship challenges during this time! Returning to the Sol system restores access to alien ship challenges.
