## Individual Vs Team Play Methods

While the game was designed to be played as a team, it can be played as an individual. If playing as an individual the player will need to interact with each workstation separately and to initiate a launch.

If playing as a team, it is recommended that team members be assigned the following tasks:

1. Crew member routes power to Launch Mode at the Power Workstation.
2. Crew member enters given coordinates at the Navigation System Workstation and relays Calibrations to crew member at Flight Engineer Workstation.
3. Crew member enters and locks Calibrations, then engages Thrusters, on Flight Engineer Workstation.
4. Crew member ejects the Data Cube from Navigation System Workstation and inserts it into the CubeDrive Workstation.

## Ship Layout

*Dauntless* is the first Earth ship to contain CubeDrive technology. This power system does not require refueling or recharging. It does require the crew to follow a specific set of steps to launch the ship into deep space.

### Workstation Descriptions

Workstations control ship functions. Navigate to workstations by selecting them in the ship. Only one user can engage a workstation at a time. The words **In Use** appear when a user is trying to access an occupied workstation.

## Heads-Up Display (HUD) Controls

The Heads-up Display (HUD) contains a variety of information about the mission and the competition. HUD controls display on the screen when you are viewing the ship. HUD controls help you navigate, manage missions, track decrypted alien codices, and guide you through the
*Dauntless*' operations.

## System Functions

Workstations on the *Dauntless* can only be used by one crew member at a time. Refer to "Workstation Descriptions" for a refresher on the functions of each workstation.

The Launch Sequence procedure must be followed to successfully launch the *Dauntless*. All launch sequence workstations have an emergency ABORT button. Press ABORT to reset the Launch Sequence.

### Power Management

Effective power management on the *Dauntless* is essential when traveling in deep space. Before and after space travel, the crew should monitor *Dauntless*' Power Workstation to ensure power is routed to the correct mode: Launch Mode or Exploration Mode.

Communication with other life forms occurs over Video Transmissions; these transmissions are archived in the Mission Log.

## Launch Sequence

Strict adherence to the Launch Sequence is required to initiate deep space travel. The crew of the *Dauntless* must complete the Launch Sequence anytime CubeDrive technology is used.

**Getting from planet to planet is how you get from challenge to challenge.**

## Launch Procedure

At the **Power Workstation**:

## Your Mission

Once connected to the game, click on 'Misson Log' in the upper-right corner. The mission log is your go-to guide for completing the challenges. Clicking on each of the missions will reveal tasks required for completing that mission and earning the codex. The first step for each mission is to travel to the appropriate destination. The Mission Log provides the location to travel to. Follow the Launch Procedures to launch Dauntless to the appropriate location and start the mission.
