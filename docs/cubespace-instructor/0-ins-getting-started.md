## Individual Vs Team Play Methods

While the game was designed to be played as a team, it can be played as an individual. If playing as an individual the player will need to interact with each workstation separately and to initiate a launch.

If playing as a team, it is recommended that team members be assigned the following tasks:

1. Crew member routes power to Launch Mode at the Power Workstation.
2. Crew member enters given coordinates at the Navigation System Workstation and relays Calibrations to crew member at Flight Engineer Workstation.
3. Crew member enters and locks Calibrations, then engages Thrusters, on Flight Engineer Workstation.
4. Crew member ejects the Data Cube from Navigation System Workstation and inserts it into the CubeDrive Workstation.
