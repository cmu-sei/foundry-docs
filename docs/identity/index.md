# Identity Docs

Identity is an identity provider (IdP) web application that uses the [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/) authentication protocol. Developed by Carnegie Mellon University's [Software Engineering Institute](https://github.com/cmu-sei) (SEI), **Identity** is the system where Foundry digital identities are created, managed, and stored. Before using TopoMojo and Gameboard, users must authenticate to Identity.

*Identity docs* explains Identity from an administrator and player (user) perspective.
