# Gameboard Competition Support Interface

The gameboard platform comes with a built-in customer support interface so that competition hosts and administrators can assist competitors and players. This way, Gameboard is a "one-stop shop" and no outside apps or systems are required to track and measure issues reported by participants.

You must have either Support role or Admin role to use the support feature and manage tickets. Assuming you have been granted the appropriate role in Gameboard, select **Support**.

## Support from participant point-of-view

### Creating new support ticket

From either of these locations <!--Once I see it in Launchpad, I can add more detail here-->, click **Create Ticket**. If you are coming from the challenge screen, then the Support Code, player id, and challenge id are automatically generated; if you are not, then this information can be added later.  

In the **Summary**, enter a brief statement of the problem.

In the **Description**, enter a more detailed statement of your problem. Include error messages and other pertinent details.

Under **Attachments**, attach files--especially screen shots--here.

Click **Submit**.

After submitting the ticket, you can always **add a comment** and attach another file. Updates to a ticket are tracked under Activity. View a status change or an assignment change here. 

### Finding an existing ticket

From the Support page, use the dropdowns and the **Search** field to locate existing tickets. Filter tickets by status:
- Any and All
- Open
- In progress
- Not closed (*open* plus *in progress*)
- Closed  

Filter by assigned to you, unassigned, and assigned to anyone.

Search by entering terms. Search covers ticket summary, labels, challenge titles, and player name. 

## Support from the Support role point-of-view 

Click the links at the top to instantly jump to challenge details, player details, and game details. <!--I'll add more detail here, too, when I can see and test.-->

### Creating new support ticket

The procedure for support role staff to create a tickets is very similar to procedure for participants to create a ticket (see above). However, after a ticket has been created users with the support staff role have more options to manage the tickets.  

### Managing support tickets

From the Ticket management side-bar:

**Assigned to:** Assign the ticket to another support person. The dropdown is filtered by users who have been granted the support role. 
	
**Status:** Move the ticket through the support workflow. Tickets are `Open`, `In progress`, or `Closed`.

- **Open** - Indicates that ticket has been reported, but not yet acted upon by support staff. The ticket is "waiting" on an action.
- **In progress** - The ticket is actively being worked on.
- **Closed** - The ticket has been resolved and no longer requires action from support or participants.

**Labels:** Labels are tags or keywords used to categorize the ticket. A label is like a hashtag (#) used on Twitter, Facebook, and other social apps. Labels help when searching for an issue; labels also help when reporting on metrics from your competition.

**Challenge:** When a ticket is associated with a challenge--meaning that the ticket was created from within the specific challenge--the challenge support code is shown here. If the challenge field is blank, you can view the challenge(s) the player is a part of in the Challenge dropdown. Attach the correct challenge from here.

**Player:** When a ticket is associated with a challenge it is also linked to a team or player. If the challenge is a team challenge, then all of the members of the team can view the ticket.

Add a **comment** to communicate with the participant.

## Support-related Reporting

<!--This will change for sure. Just don't want to forget about writing this. If it is brief enough, I may include it in my Admin settings doc.-->

Some support-related reporting is provided in Gameboard to provide you with a way to track trends, manage workloads, and track trends during your competition. In the top-right corner, select **Admin**. Then click **Reports**, and **Support Reports**.
